# Health Tracker

The idea is to develop a mobile web friendly web application to store and manage your health data with a very easy and clean user interface. 

The program was developed as simple as possible using only:
  * html
  * css 
  * javascript (Model-View-Octopus/Model-View-Controller + State Pattern + Module Revealing Pattern)
     
I used only one famous library: bootstrap.

  - **Nice Features:**
    * You can track Body Weight, Blood Pressure and Blood Sugar.
    * The app has an incredible user-friendly interface! No ads!
    * Remove, Edit or delete item
    * Canvas Dinamically Graphic 
 
## In Development/TODO: 
 
  - Working: Firebase (back server) integration!!!
  
  ~~~~
  Next steps:
   1-Blood Pressure
   2-Blood Sugar
   3-Design Improvement
   4-Code Refactor to React?
   5-Integration with microcontroler (Automation!): 
    option number 1: Espruino 
    option number 2: Raspberry 
    option number 3: Arduino

#### Note about ES6 

The code in this project has been written mainly in ES6 JavaScript. The code is compatible with modern web browsers and future-proofing JavaScript code. 
* A very nice thing about this code is that we used here two JavaScript Design Patterns: 
  1) State Pattern Design: used to change the state of the page (so we have in this case only one html file)!
  2) Module Revealing Pattern: nice way to program using this pattern! 
  3) Additionally we used the **Architectural Pattern called: MVO or MVC**:
  Beside these two javasript pattern design we use the architectural MVO/MVC pattern: Model View Octupus/Model View Controller 
  (an incredible amazing way to organize the code making it more scalable)!  
**Special Note: I liked very much to combine MVO using Module Revealing Pattern!!! I can change different modules without disturbing the code and 
it is easier for everybody to understand the logic and syntax of it!**

* The design was done using CSS and Bootstrap.
